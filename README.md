## What is Nemotron?

[NVIDIA Nemotron](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron) is a family of open, high-efficiency models with fully transparent training data, weights, and recipes.

Nemotron models are designed for **agentic AI workflows**—they excel at coding, math, scientific reasoning, tool calling, instruction following, and visual reasoning. Models are optimized for deployment across edge, single GPU, and data center environments, with support for NeMo, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang, and NIM microservices.

## Training Recipes

The Nemotron Training Cookbook provides complete, reproducible training pipelines that show the full journey from raw data to deployment-ready models. These implementations reflect how large language models are trained at leading AI labs—through rigorous, scientific processes with careful experimentation, validation gates, and systematic optimization.

### Why Complete Training Pipelines

Training a production model involves interconnected components where isolated examples miss critical interactions between stages. Complete pipelines show:

- **How data quality affects downstream performance** across pretraining, SFT, and RL stages
- **Which training techniques work together** in practice, not just theory
- **Where validation gates prevent failures** and ensure reproducibility
- **How to balance competing objectives** across training stages

Because these are complete systems, practitioners can extract specific techniques with confidence—each component has been proven to work in a production context.

### Available Recipes

| Model | Description | Stages | Guide |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **[Nemotron 3 Nano](docs/train/nano3/README.md)** | 3.6B active / 31.6B total MoE Hybrid Mamba-Transformer for agentic reasoning | Pretrain → SFT → RL | [Training Guide](docs/train/nano3/README.md) |

### Nemotron 3 Nano

A complete training recipe for the open, efficient Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer model optimized for agentic reasoning.

> **Open-Source Data Only**: These recipes train exclusively on the open-sourced subset of training data. Results will differ from the tech report benchmarks, which used additional proprietary data. Use these recipes as reference implementations to apply the methodology with your own data.

**Model Specifications**:
- 31.6B total parameters, 3.6B active per forward pass
- 25 trillion pretraining tokens with curriculum learning
- Up to 1M context length
- 3.3x higher inference throughput than similarly sized models

**What You Can Extract**:
- Curriculum-based pretraining with two-phase data mixture
- Long-context extension via CPT methodology
- Multi-domain SFT with 12+ data sources
- InfinityByte cross-domain code synthesis
- Tool-calling fine-tuning and budget-controlled reasoning
- Multi-environment RLVR with GRPO
- GenRM reward modeling with circular comparison
- DPO for tool hallucination reduction
